# AI-Powered Food Recipe Generator

## Objective

The objective of this Python program is to generate unique and creative food recipes automatically using AI algorithms and natural language processing techniques. The program utilizes web scraping, NLP libraries, and Hugging Face's small models to acquire ingredient information, instructions, and other relevant data from online sources to generate innovative and diverse recipes.

## Features and Capabilities

1. **Web Scraping and Data Collection:** The program employs web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup to extract data from various recipe websites. It retrieves information such as ingredients, cooking instructions, and nutritional values for a wide range of recipes. The collected data becomes the foundation for generating new recipe ideas.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Algorithms:** The program utilizes NLP libraries like NLTK or SpaCy to process the acquired recipe data. It extracts important keywords, identifies relationships between ingredients, and applies semantic analysis to understand recipe structures and cooking techniques.

3. **AI Recipe Generation:** Leveraging Hugging Face's small models, such as GPT-2 or T5, the program generates unique and creative food recipes. By using a combination of the extracted data, keywords, and NLP algorithms, it creates recipes that align with specific cuisines, dietary preferences, or ingredient combinations specified by the user.

4. **Recipe Customization:** The program allows users to customize generated recipes based on personal preferences such as dietary restrictions, flavor profiles, or preferred cooking methods. It can adapt the generated recipes to accommodate vegan, gluten-free, or other specific dietary needs.

5. **Recipe Evaluation and Ranking:** The program uses sentiment analysis techniques to evaluate the quality and appeal of generated recipes. It ranks them based on factors like taste, nutritional value, and ease of preparation, helping users find the recipes that best suit their needs.

6. **Ingredient Substitution:** The program suggests ingredient substitutions or alternatives based on user preferences or ingredient availability. This feature enables users to adapt the recipes to their specific ingredient inventory or dietary needs.

7. **User Feedback and Rating:** The program allows users to provide feedback on generated recipes and rate their overall experience. This feedback helps improve future recipe generation and enhances user satisfaction.

## Benefits

1. **Inspiration for Novel Recipes:** The AI-powered recipe generator provides users with a constant source of fresh and innovative recipe ideas, helping them discover new and exciting dishes.

2. **Time and Effort Savings:** Users can rely on the program to automatically create recipes tailored to their preferences, eliminating the need for manual searching and trial-and-error experimentation.

3. **Personalization and Adaptability:** The ability to customize and substitute ingredients in the generated recipes ensures that users can accommodate their dietary restrictions, preferences, and ingredient availability.

4. **Enhanced Cooking Experience:** The program encourages users to explore diverse cuisines and experiment with new ingredients, making their cooking experience more adventurous and enjoyable.

5. **Crowdsourced Recipe Library:** With user feedback and ratings, the program can curate a database of high-quality recipes, continually improving the recipe generation process and offering a valuable resource for the community.

```

2. Define the `Recipe` class, which is responsible for scraping recipe data from a given URL:

```python
class Recipe:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url
        self.ingredients = []
        self.instructions = []
        self.nutritional_values = {}

    def scrape_recipe(self):
        # Logic to scrape recipe data from the web page

    def extract_ingredients(self, soup):
        # Logic to extract ingredients from the web page

    def extract_instructions(self, soup):
        # Logic to extract cooking instructions from the web page

    def extract_nutritional_values(self, soup):
        # Logic to extract nutritional values from the web page
```

3. Define the `RecipeGenerator` class, which is responsible for scraping multiple recipe websites, processing the recipe data, and generating new recipes:

```python
class RecipeGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.recipes = []

    def scrape_recipe_websites(self):
        # Logic to scrape recipe websites and create Recipe objects

    def process_recipe_data(self):
        # Logic to process recipe data extracted from web pages

    def generate_recipe(self):
        # Logic to generate a new recipe using Hugging Face's small models
```

4. Define the `RecipeCustomizer` class, which allows users to customize the generated recipes:

```python
class RecipeCustomizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.recipe_generator = RecipeGenerator()

    def customize_recipe(self):
        # Logic to customize the generated recipe based on user preferences

    def get_user_preferences(self):
        # Logic to get user preferences

    def get_dietary_restrictions(self):
        # Logic to get user's dietary restrictions

    def get_flavor_profiles(self):
        # Logic to get user's flavor profiles

    def get_cooking_methods(self):
        # Logic to get user's preferred cooking methods
```

5. Define the `RecipeEvaluator` class, which allows users to evaluate the generated recipes:

```python
class RecipeEvaluator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.recipe_generator = RecipeGenerator()

    def evaluate_recipe(self):
        # Logic to evaluate the generated recipe based on various factors

    def perform_sentiment_analysis(self):
        # Logic to perform sentiment analysis on the generated recipe

    def calculate_taste_score(self):
        # Logic to calculate the taste score of the recipe

    def calculate_nutritional_value_score(self):

        self.recipe_generator = RecipeGenerator()

    def suggest_substitutions(self):
        # Logic to suggest ingredient substitutions based on user preferences and ingredient availability

    def get_user_preferences(self):
        # Logic to get user preferences

    def get_ingredient_availability(self):
        # Logic to check ingredient availability
```

7. Define the `UserFeedback` class, which allows users to provide feedback on the generated recipes:

```python

    customized_recipe = recipe_customizer.customize_recipe()
    print(customized_recipe)

    recipe_evaluator = RecipeEvaluator()
    overall_rating = recipe_evaluator.evaluate_recipe()
    print(overall_rating)

    ingredient_substitution = IngredientSubstitution()
    substitutions = ingredient_substitution.suggest_substitutions()
    print(substitutions)

    user_feedback = UserFeedback()
    feedback_confirmation = user_feedback.provide_feedback()
    print(feedback_confirmation)
```
